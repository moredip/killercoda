# Five Minutes to Feature Flags

We're going to add feature flagging to a node service in under five minutes using OpenFeature, the open, vendor-agnostic feature flagging SDK.

In this hands-on tutorial we'll be working with a simple [express](https://expressjs.com/) server. If you have some basic familiarity with JavaScript and node you should be able to follow along.
